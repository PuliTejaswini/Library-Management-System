Borrowing and Returning Books: Users can borrow books by providing their library card details, and librarians can easily process returns.
User Management: The system maintains information about library members and borrowing history.
Search and Filter: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre, and librarians can filter books based on various criteria.
Technologies Used:

Java: Object-oriented programming language used for the backend development.
MySQL: Relational database management system used for storing and managing library data.
Git: Version control system used for managing project code and collaboration.
GitHub: Platform used for hosting the project repository and facilitating code sharing and collaboration.
This project aims to streamline library management processes, improve user experience, and provide a robust and scalable solution for libraries of any size.
